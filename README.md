# Brioche

Brioche is a barebones UI component library for React. It is intended for use with web apps or sites which use routing (think: `react-router` and `react-router-dom`).

It is currently under heavy development and is *strictly not* recommended for use in production apps/sites. Use it at your own peril.

An example of a site which uses an early version of Brioche is [my personal website](https://clarencesiew.com) (before it was transformed into a library).
